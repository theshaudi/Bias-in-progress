# Bias-in-progress: Plans to complete by Demo

** Dataset generation files (generic)
There will be four distinct types of dataset generation

** Code that takes in Parameters, and spits out a specific file
Figure out if we can make this piece more interactive so nontechnical folks can use it

** ML model guidance file (text file no code)
Build one out each for Regression and Classification model 

** ML testing module
Build one out each for Regression and Classification model, and for any future models that might make it in by the demo date

-- ML Metrics files (How can people tell their code is biased? Need to include these for every use case)
Build one out each for Regression and Classification model
